        <title> QAR: Guided Practice </title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; [to student] So what I want to do now, is to do one together, so that you begin to be more comfortable with it. So we’ll put away “Keeping Kids Safe” [the teacher moves that passage out of the way], and I’m going to have you read an article about a famous woman, a woman from history. Her name is Harriet Tubman. And I want you to read through this before we start to work on it; there may be some words in it that you’re not familiar with, and if so, just be sure and ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[time passes as student finishes reading the passage. Teacher makes sure student is finished:]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay? An interesting woman, don’t you think? [student agrees] A very strong woman! She did some things that I’m not sure that I would be able to do, I know that! [the words, “Guided Practice” appear on the screen]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right, let’s look at these together: we’ve got our kinds of questions and we’ve got the article that we can look back to. And I’m going to let you do the writing this time, and our first question is, “When was Harriet Tubman born?” What kind of question do you think that is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe that’s a “right there” question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a “right there” because…? We can look…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; And see the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And it was in…? What year was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; 1820.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; 1820, so first we would put, it’s a “right there” kind of question. [student writes down that it’s a “right there” kind of question]…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And 1820 is our answer, so we’ll go ahead and put that…[student writes down the answer] [Fade/transition to “Think and Search” practice]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did she have seizures? What happened to her to make her have seizures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; She had blocked the doorway for a slave, and the overseer picked up a big metal piece and hit her—with a “heavy metal piece” it says right here [student indicates the place in the passage]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; …and hit her over the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, he hit her in the head, and so… She was even unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Unconscious—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; …for days! So, she suffered from seizures because of that hit in the head. So you’re right, it is a “right there” question, we found it right there in the paragraph. [student writes down the answer]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; and she had gotten hit in the head with a heavy metal weight. [student looks for the place in the passage and teacher points it out; student writes down the answer]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. [teacher reads next question] “What was the Underground Railroad?” Now, this question… is there one sentence that you can just point to and it tells you exactly what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Not really, is there? It’s kind of a little bit more difficult. Do you see where it does talk about the Underground Railroad? [student looks and indicates where in the passage]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, right here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right, that’s one spot it does… and it also mentions it up here at the beginning, too [teacher indicates where in the passage], because it says, “She led more than 300 slaves, including her parents, to freedom along the Underground Railroad”. And then, you’re right, there’s another part about it. [teacher reads from passage:] “She had heard of safe houses where runaway slaves would be fed and sheltered; they were part of a movement called the Underground Railroad. With the help of this…” [Fade/transition to “Writer and Me” practice]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; The last question: “Why was Harriet Tubman like Moses? Why was ‘Moses’ a good name for her?” This “why”… “Why was she like Moses? Why was that a good name for her?” What kind of question do you think this is? Did we see the answer “right there” in any sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Not really. Is there several different places where they talk about Moses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; No. Well, I think of the Bible when they say ‘Moses’…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; …and how he helped his people…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, exactly! He helped them to get out of what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of bondage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Out of bondage, or slavery, exactly! So why was she like Moses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; She helped the slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; She helped the slaves the same way that he helped the slaves to leave Egypt, exactly. Does it tell us anything about Moses leading people out of slavery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So what kind of question is this going to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; “The writer and me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; “The writer and me”, exactly! So then we would put [indicating the student’s answer sheet] “the writer and me”… [student does so] …and you knew a lot about Moses already, so you made that connection—that’s great!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title>QAR: Independent Practice</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Now what I’d like to do today, is to send you home with some homework. I’d like to give you a passage to take home and some questions to answer, and I’m going to make sure that you have our sheet with the 3 different kinds of questions that we’ve talked about. The passage is called, “Pay Yourself First”. It’s an interesting passage. When I think about that title, “Pay Myself First”, uhhh [teacher makes a sound of confusion or trepidation], well, usually I think about my boss paying me, but I don’t think about paying myself! So you’ll have to read this and find out what they mean by “pay yourself first”. There are some questions that you can answer, and try to figure out what kind of question it is before you answer it. And then when you come back next time we’ll go over these—and if you don’t get one or two, that’s okay, we’ll work on it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Later, when the teacher and student are going over the answers together]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, the first question was “What kind of car did Tim and Ann own?”, and you said that that was what kind of question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; “Right there” question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And you found it right in the very first sentence, didn’t you? They had an ’89 four-door Ford. [reading the next question:] “According to this writer, what does it mean to take good care of a car?” What kind of question did you think that was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; That was a “think and search”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right. You had to kind of put some information together from what was said. It said… “They had taken good care of it”, but then you had to go into some other sentences and find… And you said they changed their oil, and they, you said they made repairs, good; and they did, they kept it clean, which is kind of hard with children, isn’t it? The third question, “What kind of problems has the car had recently?” And you said that was a “right there” question, and where did you find the answer to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Student indicates where in the passage]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; You said it was rusty… and leaking some oil. Good, you found it, right there, good! [teacher continues reading the next question] “What does it mean to ‘pay yourself first’?” Now this was the title of the article… Was it answered in one sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Was it a “right there”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; No, you had to think and search and put together some information from a couple of different paragraphs, didn’t you? And you said that they, before they paid any bills, they set aside, you said fifty dollars every pay that they got…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; They set up a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, good it was, it was a regular part of their budget; in that paragraph it tells us that. So you had to think a little bit about what it meant, and then put together some different things, from some different sentences there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Teacher reads the next question:] “What does the word ‘interest’ mean in this story?” You said that was a “writer and me”… Okay, I see where you’ve underlined the word ‘interest’… It used it there, we see it, but it didn’t really say what it was, did it? It says, “Putting their money in a savings account would earn them interest on their money… it was a safe place to keep their savings”… so you said that interest was “the money that the bank gives you for saving”—yes, they pay you to save money, how about that? Good! So you took some information that was here [indicates the place in the passage], and you knew “earning”—they were earning something— and you put it together with information you already knew about interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title> SIA: Math Guided Practice #1</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Anybody watch the Super Bowl last year? These problems are all about the Super Bowl; I made them up last year right after the Super Bowl. Okay, so read problem 1 for us… let’s see, Mackenzie, will you read for us, please?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mackenzie:&lt;/strong&gt; A ticket to the Super Bowl game costs 500 dollars, plus 8 percent entertainment tax. What was the total cost of a ticket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right… So how are we going to set that up? [She erases whiteboard, while students think.] Who can give me the equation to solve that? [calls on student] Zif?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zif:&lt;/strong&gt; 500 dollars times point zero eight…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; okay… and let’s do this one on scratch paper, that’s pretty easy, you don’t need to use your calculator… What will we find when we solve that problem? What is that going to give us? Eric?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric:&lt;/strong&gt; [a mumble] Forty dollars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And what does the forty dollars represent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric:&lt;/strong&gt; Um…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it the cost of the ticket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it’s like, um… I don’t know. I think, more, um…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; What does the eight percent refer to? [we hear a student mumble]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Imelda, what does the eight percent refer to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imelda:&lt;/strong&gt; [unintelligible] …for the tax and entertainment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, so the forty dollars is the tax amount, right? Okay; so you’ll pay forty dollars tax; so what will the total cost of the ticket be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Imelda:&lt;/strong&gt; Five-forty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, you have to add that together. [She writes on the whiteboard: 500 + 40 = 540.] Okay? Any questions?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title>SIA: Math Guided Practice #2</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;[Teacher is at the front of the room with a whiteboard, class with 10-12 adult learners facing the board. Student are at long tables – can work in pairs easily.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Another way that we looked at for doing percent problems is using the percent triangle… [she sketches a triangle on the board]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a visual way of representing this same equation… [she draws on the triangle: a horizontal line halfway down divides the top and bottom parts of the triangle. In the top half, above the line, she has written the letter P (to stand for “Part”); below the line she has written the symbols “% x W” that indicate “percent times the whole”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So let’s do the second problem on the handout and use the triangle. Can you read that one for us, please, Alex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex:&lt;/strong&gt; Ben Roethlisberger completed seventy percent of his passes. He attempted thirty passes. How many were completed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right. And how would we set that up? Are we looking for the part, the percent, or the whole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Vinza, what are we looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinza:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt;? “He attempted thirty”—so that’s the “whole”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinza:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, yeah. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, so we’re looking for the part, the part that he completed, all right? So if we use the triangle, we cover up the part…[she puts her hand over the P in the top part of the triangle]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...And it also tells us to multiply. So go ahead and do the arithmetic there… Do it on scratch paper!… On this handout, you can only use the calculator when you see the calculator picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Teacher approaches a student]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you do it on scratch paper, Maria? Only use the calculator on those two. Okay, so what did you multiply? [student mumbles] Vinza?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinza:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah… [mumbles] so I multiplied point seventy by thirty…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; By thirty. Okay… And what did you come up with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Vinza mumbles]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Twenty-one? Okay, so he completed twenty one of his passes. Does that seem like a reasonable answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinza:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; It should be more than half, shouldn’t it, if it’s seventy percent. Okay, good! How many of you like the formula method best for solving percent problems? [she indicates the formula written on the board: “P = % x W” (“the part is equal to the percent times the whole”). A few students raise their hands.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; How many like the percent triangle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[the students giggle nervously, only a few raise their hands]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of you don’t know! Or do you have a different way? Does somebody have a different way that they like? What way do you like, Venta?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinza: &lt;/strong&gt;I really like this one…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[teacher points to the percent triangle]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; This one… okay, so you like the triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venta:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that’s easier… It’s easier to remember&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t care which one you use, but I would recommend that you decide which of these methods do you like best, and stick with it. So on the rest of the problems we do today, you can use whichever method you want… But it’s going to be easier for you to remember if you always use the same method over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem that it seems like people have in solving percent problems is knowing whether you’re supposed to multiply or divide, and either of these methods can help you decide for a particular problem, “Do I need to multiply or divide?”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title> SIA: Peer-Assisted Guided Practice </title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;[Teacher starts at the front of the room with a worksheet in her hand, class with 10-12 adult learners facing the board. Student are at long tables – can work in pairs easily.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; We just have a little bit of time left, so we are going to end with a shopping activity. Look on the back side of your handout—and I want you to work in partners—um, yeah, we’ve got two everywhere… I’ve put some ads on your table, you can choose whichever ones you want, and I want you to choose one thing to buy, so the two of you have to agree on one thing to buy. You have a coupon for fifteen percent off the purchase of that one item, and so then do A, B, C, D: first you’re going to find out how much your purchase will cost with the discount… then add the sales tax… then you’re going to put the purchase on a six-month installment plan… but the store charges five percent of the total cost to do that, so you have to figure out how much that will be and what your monthly payment will be…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the last one says that your payment should not be more than ten percent of your income, so see if your payment is less than ten percent of your monthly income of twelve hundred dollars. Okay? It’s all on your handout there. So work with your partner; if you get stuck, raise your hand, I’ll come around and check how you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Students begin to talk with their partners, Teacher moves among them.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher [as she moves among students]:&lt;/strong&gt; You have to agree…. Don’t spend too much time deciding on a purchase, or you won’t have time to do the problems. You can dream! Pick something expensive! This is ‘fake’ money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Students working together, audio is low, jumbled and unclear.] Teacher [to another student]: Did you choose something to purchase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; A couch…ooo nice! Love it! Okay… A nice, easy number, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher [to another set of students]:&lt;/strong&gt; What did you ladies pick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; A TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, very good…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher [to another set of students]:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you chosen what you’re going to buy? [student mumbles something about searching for 15%] Pick what you want to buy, then you’ll figure out fifteen percent off. So just pick something you want. You have to agree, though. [Touches partner’s shoulder]…Did you find something? You and Angelina are going to work together, so you need to decide together. You have to fight over what you’re going to buy [Teacher laughs].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Audio becomes jumbled, as the whole class is busy talking about the problems with their partners. Teacher continues to keep various groups of students on track, encouraging them to agree on a choice and reminding them of next steps, such as:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• “This is your sale price, so now you’re looking for fifteen percent of that, right?”;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• “Are you looking for the part, the percent, or the whole? You’re looking for the part; the ‘whole’ is how much it costs”;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• “It’s just like how you found the discount, except with the discount you subtracted the discount, and the sales tax, you add it on to find out how much it is.”.]&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher [to whole class]:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, I see several of you are having trouble with Part D. So you know that your monthly income is twelve hundred… and you found out what the payment will be for whatever you’re purchasing; what part of a percent problem is that? It’s the part, right? So you’ll divide to see what percent it is, and make sure that it is under ten percent. The store won’t let you have the purchase plan if it is more than ten percent of your income. So divide whatever the monthly payment is under the installment plan by twelve hundred, to see what percent it is of your monthly income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher [to a set of two students]:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s okay to do it that way, too…so you know that ten percent is a hundred and twenty, and then you would compare that.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <content>&lt;p&gt;[Teacher is at the front of the room with a whiteboard, class with 10-12 adult learners facing the board. Student are at long tables – can work in pairs easily.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so we’ve looked at the Part, when we knew the percent and the whole; now let’s talk about how to find the percent when we know the part and the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are some examples of that in real life? When do you need to find the percent of something? Venta?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venta:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we need to divide the part to the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, when we’re looking for this, you’re right: we divide the part by the whole. [She writes “% = P/W”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are some examples of when we would need to do that? When do you have to find the percent? Everybody that’s been in school knows this: when you want to know the percent you got right on a test? If you got 62 right and the test had 85 questions…[She writes “62/85” on the board]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… you get the percent, by dividing the part by the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; When else do we have to find percents? How about surveys? When they take a survey, the number of people that answered a certain way, divided by the total number of people who were surveyed… or election results: it’s the part of the people that voted a certain way divided by the total number of people that voted, okay? The example we did before: how many-- what percentage of guys are in the class? The number of guys divided by the total number in the class. Okay? So all kinds of ways that we need to find the percent in real life. Let’s do this problem. [She indicates on the board where she previously wrote “62/85”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Sixty-two right divided by 85 total on the test… you can use your calculator for that one… Okay, who got that one? Venta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venta:&lt;/strong&gt; Zero seventy-two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Zero, seven, two—where’s the decimal point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venta:&lt;/strong&gt; Zero, point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venta:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And turn it into a percent…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venta:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah! Seventy-two percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. Okay: So, remember, whether you divide it on your calculator or on paper, you’re going to get a decimal answer, you have to move it over 2 places. [She indicates the decimal point in the number “0.72”, then indicates two places to the right, after the digit “2”] … to turn it into the percent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;div class="caption-line-time"&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teacher:&lt;/b&gt; So let’s review what we’ve done today. We covered a lot of different kinds of percent problems that you might see in real life or on the GED. We did finding the part, finding the percent, finding the whole - you can use either of these methods - and we also looked at how to find the percent increase or decrease with that extra step of having to subtract or add to see how much the decrease is. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;After the break, we’re going to look at finding interest, which is another very real-life application of percents, and then we’ll also get started on the measurement. Okay? So let’s take a break. Be back in about five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
