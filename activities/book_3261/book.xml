        <title>Comprehension: Finding the Topic</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK. Good morning, class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for moving to the tables. I appreciate it. We're going to move onto comprehension, like my agenda says over here. Comprehension. Today we're going to be working on finding the topic. OK. Many of you uh, have expressed that you uh, need help in understanding paragraphs. Yes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK. Well today we're going to be learning how to identify the topic. Because really, in order to get the main idea of a paragraph, the first step you got to do is identify the topic. OK. Now what is a topic? Basically, the topic is what something is about. It's that simple. What is this picture about? Tell me the topic. What is this paragraph about? Tell me the topic. What is this passage about? Tell me the topic. The topic is, what is this about. So, let me show you what I do using a picture whenever I have to identify a topic. So, I look at this picture, I look at this picture here, and I think, OK, well, hmm, the topic? Well, what is this picture about? Well this picture to me, I see a Christmas tree, I see presents, I see a fireplace. OK. Well, this, the topic of this picture to me is Christmas. Christmas. OK. I see, that, it's not about the Christmas tree. It's not about the presents. The whole topic is Christmas. OK. So would you agree with me that this is, the topic is Christmas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. OK. Somebody asks me what's this picture's about, usually in one word or in a couple of words, a phrase, I'll tell them, the topic of this picture is Christmas. OK. I feel good about this. I don't feel, I don't feel like I'm doubting. No, this is about Christmas. Now, when you look at a picture, OK, you have to ask yourself the same question. Well what is this picture about? What is this picture about? Let's do one together. Can you guys help me do one together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK. Now if I take a look at this picture right here. Can everybody see this picture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Now if I take a look at this picture, huh, I see Come, Sit, Stay, Play. I see a lot of cute dogs. Actually my favorite is this one. OK. But I have to ask myself what, what is this topic about? What would you say the topic of this picture is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs. Dogs. And thank you for giving me, giving it to me in just one simple word, OK. Dogs. Christmas. And, dogs. OK. Can, can we do one together. You, you guys, do you guys understand what the topic of these pictures, what I'm doing here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Alright. Why don't we try in pairs figuring out what the topic of the next pictures are. Now a paragraph has a lot of sentences, together, and they're all talking about one topic. OK. Let me show you what I do when I see a paragraph. People throughout history have liked mustard. Huh, I like mustard. Mustard has been a popular spice in cooking for more than 5000 years. I didn't know that. OK. A cookbook written in 3000 BC mentions mustard. Wow, that's a long time ago. Ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Greeks and Romans all used mustard. The Spanish took it with them when they sailed to the New World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, OK. Well, I keep, I keep seeing the word mustard, mustard, mustard, mustard. OK. You know, I think the topic of this paragraph, it's gotta be mustard. It's gotta be mustard.OK. Now you guys, I could have said cooking. I could have said spices. I could have said ancient people. But all of those would've been just small details of the story. If somebody asks me, and they don't have time, what did you read about today? I'll say mustard, OK. Mustard. Now what we're going to do is, we're going to do one together. OK. We're going to read a paragraph and we're going to identify what the topic is. We're going to ask ourselves questions. What is this about? Okie dokie. Now, can everybody see this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Paris, France is one of the world’s most famous cities. Alright, what would you say the topic of this paragraph is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Paris, France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; One more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Paris, France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK. Alright. Good, good. How did that feel? Was that, was that good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Was that comfortable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Alright, good. Any questions? Any questions? Now, what we're going to do, is we're going to separate into your comprehension groups and then you're going to try and uh, figure out, identify the topics for paragraphs at your particular groups. Sound like a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher: &lt;/strong&gt;Alright, so I'm going to be moving you guys around. Alright, so you guys so we identified the topic of one paragraph. Paris, France. Very good. Now, realistically what's going to happen is I'm going to give you an assignment and you're going to have to find the topic of not just one paragraph, but more than one paragraph. In this case, four paragraphs. So, what I'd like to show you is how I go about, in identifying the topic of each paragraph. OK. What you guys have in front of you is the passage on "The King of Beasts". And as you can see I've numbered each paragraph. One, Two, Three, Four. OK, let me just demonstrate what I do. I'm going to do paragraph one. OK, and just go ahead and follow along with me, on the sheet in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the king of beasts? We all know the answer. It is the lion. It is the, it is the lion. A male lions weighs from 350 to 400 pounds. A few weigh up to 500 pounds. Most males are about 9 feet long. Huh. That's from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail. Most are about 3 1/2 feet tall. So if I'm 5'9", to about 3 1/2 feet tall. That is at the shoulders. Females are smaller. They weigh 250 to 300 pounds. They are about 8 feet long. They are about 8 feet long. Lions live 20 to 25 years in a zoo. How long in the jungle? No one knows. Alright. Well, I have to figure out what the topic of this paragraph is. Huh, and Mr. Verdin says that the topic of the paragraph is usually one word or a couple of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let me see. Who is the king of the beasts? We all know the answer. It is a lion. A male lion. Well, it's talking about king of the beasts. It's talking about a male lion. It's talking about female lions as well. So it's talking about male lions, female lions, king of the beasts, huh. So if somebody asks me what did you read about in this first paragraph, I think I would say lions. I think I would say lions. Lions in general because it talks about male lions. It also about, talks about female lions, so I'm going to go with, first paragraph is talking to me about lions. I, I think I'm, I think I'm going to stick with lions. OK. Alright. Did you all see what I did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher: &lt;/strong&gt;OK. I read it. I asked myself questions. I kinda just talked to myself a little bit, I'm not crazy. And I talked to myself a little bit, identified the things that were being said. And then I finally came up with, it's, I feel like, lions is what this paragraph is talking about. OK. Let's try paragraph two. But this time, we're going to do it together. Yes? Let's try paragraph two, and we're going to do it together. Help me out here, what do you guys think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; It's talking about the lions power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; It's talking about the lions power. You know, that's what I, actually that's what I was thinking too. It, it does talk about the, the paws and the claws. It also talks about the teeth. But both of those refer to the power the lion has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; About how powerful is the lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Same thing. Same thing. Very good class. You said, you said the same thing. You said the same thing. You just used different words. OK, so can we all agree that the topic of this paragraph is the lions power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher: &lt;/strong&gt;OK, good. So, so far, our first paragraph is about lions in general. The second paragraph is about the lions power. OK. Good, good. Let's try the third paragraph you guys. This time let's try the third paragraph. We're going to do it again together. If somebody were to ask you, what was the topic for paragraph three? What would you say in a word, or in a couple of words? What would you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Groups and prides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Prides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Groups. Well groups and prides, the same thing right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK. So why don't we call it prides, lion prides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, alright, that'll work. Very good you guys, that's what I would say too. Alright. Now, one more. Now this last one, I want you guys to do it on your own. Ask yourself, what is this paragraph about? What is this paragraph about? In one word or in a couple of words. Any, any ideas, any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; How the lion hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; How the lion hunts. What did you say Jorge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;About the lions prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; About the lions prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;The prey is for the lion or large prey though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So the prey? You're going back to prey? Alright, now let me ask you this. If. if you tell me that this paragraph is about the prey, is it only talking about the different types of animals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; It's only talking about animals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; No. Something about, how it hunts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; How the lion hunts those animals, right. Yes. It does talk about the animals. But the reason it talks about the animals is because it's going to talk about how it hunts the animal down. Right. So if I, OK, so given that new information, what can I put here for the topic of this paragraph?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; How the lion hunts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; How the lion hunts. Can I say lion hunting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Would that be OK? Lion hunting. That includes the prey, that includes the animals. Alright. Good, good. I agree. Lion hunting, Alright. Good. Good you guys. Does this feel a little more comfortable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; When you go and read a paragraph, and then I ask you, what is the topic of this paragraph? Do you think you'll be able to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Feel comfortable doing it? Yes? Great. Because now, I'm going to separate you and I'm going to put you guys into your own groups and you're going to prove to me what you just told me. Yes. We're going to practice some more but this time, at your own groups, at your own level. Alright. Sounds like a plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright. Good. So I'm going to move you guys around and we'll get started.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title> Introduction: Coding Text</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;[a teacher addresses her class of adult learners]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right! I’m glad everybody is back again today… We’re going to be doing something that I think might be new to you today. We’re going to be working on a comprehension strategy. Now you might have done something like this before, just on your own, that you just thought up on your own, ‘cause sometimes you just figure it out on your own. But what we’re going to teach is a specific way to do this, and we’re going to be working on something that is sometimes called “coding” [teacher makes air quotes on “coding”]: coding text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what a code is; well, this is a way that you can mark text to help you to keep track of your understanding of what you’re reading. …First of all, I’m going to show you how it can be done. We’re using a “think aloud”, and I’ve done these “think alouds” with you before, which just means that I’m going to say out loud what I would be thinking while I was reading. We know that when you’re reading silently that you’re not talking out loud, but if I’m going to try and demonstrate how I’m thinking, I have to make it out loud, because you can’t see what’s going on up here [indicates her head]. So I’m going to do a think aloud to demonstrate for you this strategy, which is a way to monitor your comprehension. It’s called a “comprehension monitoring strategy”—And what’s a “monitor”? …Think about when you’ve heard the word “monitor” used before; what do you think a monitor is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Observing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Observing, that’s part of it…. What do you think? Who’s a monitor? When somebody is monitoring, a hall monitor is doing…? [teacher indicates she would like the class to finish the sentence; various students offer responses, which the teacher repeats:] Watching, checking on, yes, exactly! So when you’re monitoring your comprehension, that means you’re watching it, you’re checking on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in that situation when you’re reading when you get all the way down to the end of the page and you realize, “Whoops! I wasn’t paying attention!”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; uh-huh! [laughs] …”Dog gone it, I gotta start over!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, comprehension monitoring strategies are good for helping to keep you from doing that. They keep you focused. Okay? So that’s what this is going to be about: It’s going to be about showing you something you can do to keep you focused on the meaning of what you’re reading, so you don’t just kind of lose your place and lose track… because you’re reading for a reason! You’re reading to understand it and if you stop paying attention, then, you know, you kind of miss out on a thing or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Teacher goes to overhead projector:]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, here’s the code. Let me first introduce what this code is about. This is a pretty simple one, I think, it’s just got 3 different kinds of marks. I’m going to show you how it works… [slide is projected onto screen at front of class. It is titled, “Code for Marking Text”.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if it doesn’t make sense, don’t worry about it—I’m going to show you. One way you can mark text is you can put a little exclamation point next to something that you think is really new and/or maybe surprising: “Wow! I didn’t know that!” “Really?!” That’s where you put the exclamation point. [the projected slide shows an exclamation point with text that says, “This is new to me. This is surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then sometimes when you’re reading, you come across a word you don’t know the meaning of, or you read the sentence and you think, “That didn’t make sense!” Or you stop in the middle of a sentence and you say, “Okay, now I’m confused!” [the projected slide text includes a question mark with the words, “I don’t understand this. I’m not sure about this. What does this mean?”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s when you put a question mark: Anytime you get to something that you don’t understand, or you’re not sure about it—even if you’re not sure about it… Now, that doesn’t mean that you’re going to be stuck forever—you might find the answer if you keep on reading. But for now, you’re monitoring your comprehension, and for now you’ve got a question mark. Everybody has that—when you’re reading, you’re reading something difficult and you go, “Uh oh, I’m confused”. Okay, we’re just saying, mark it, so that you don’t forget. Maybe you’ll get it later, but for now you’re confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I’m suggesting there that you make a check mark when you come to something that you know is important: “This looks like something important.” “This might be on the test.” “This is an important fact.” “This is the main idea.” Something like that. [the projected slide includes a check mark with the words, “This is important. I need to remember this. This is the main idea.” The line below that adds, “Also, underline important words or phrases.”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing you can do (if you like to do this), is underline or highlight. …I was always a big highlighter when I was studying something. So that’s another thing you can do for the important parts, if there’s an important word or an important phrase or something you think is important that you want to remember, you can underline it. The other thing you can do is sometimes you’ll find out that there is a sentence that introduces something, and then there’ll be several examples of it afterward—sometimes you might want to put numbers by those, like, “Oh, okay, that’s another one of those; that’s two…” [the projected slide has a final sentence: “Use numbers to identify items in a list or details that relate to a main idea.”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to show you how all of this works, and then we’ll put this back up later. For now, does this make sense, what we’re going to do? Does this make sense? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
