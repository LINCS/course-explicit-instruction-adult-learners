        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So, I have a little activity for you to reinforce this. On the table, you see the blue strips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to take, with a partner, one or two partners, to organize those blue strips into a description of a paragraph, describing the topic sentence, the supporting details, and the concluding sentence. But I have a special task for Ijaz and Mar. [&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher pulls a large yellow piece of paper from the white board and places it in front of two students on the front row.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, you are going to do yours on this yellow paper. Okay, so everybody else will do it on the table; I want you to do yours here to show the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you can look at your paragraph, look at your hamburger, and try to organize this. Tommy… Tommy and Pilar are working together… Work together. Work with at least one or two other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to squeeze past and see what they’re doing, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[students work with their partners, discussing the order of the blue strips as the teacher walks around the room and observes the students.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Good, good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the topic sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s like the bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Now we have to figure out which one…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the topic sentence. It’s important that it introduces your readers to the paragraph. Good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your supporting details… sticks to the topic… interesting and important details… supports the topic sentence. Good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, let’s take a look over here. Okay, good: your topic sentence, that’s your bun top…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Teacher returns to the front of the room and addresses the whole class.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Good, that’s great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right; circulating, I saw that everybody did a really good job of this. Let’s check your answers now. Mar, Ijaz, will you mind bringing your paper up and reviewing the parts of the paragraph from your paper. Okay, class, now I’d like you to check your answers and see if your answers agree with what Ijaz and Mar came up with. So, Ijaz, can you tell us about what you have for the topic sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Ijaz:&lt;/strong&gt; This sentence tells your reader what the program is about. This is important since introduce, introduces your reader to the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; The paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Ijaz:&lt;/strong&gt; The paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, class, do you agree? Do you agree with Ijaz?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, all right. The class is in agreement so far! Okay, Mar, what about supporting details?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, supporting details. This sentence always stick of the topic sentence and this sentences give interesting and important details for that support and explains your topic sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Class, do you agree or disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; You agree? Okay, all right. So what about the concluding sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Ijaz:&lt;/strong&gt; Concluding sentence. This is, this is, “This sentence gives a summary of what the program— paragraph—is about. This sentence close the program—paragraph. This sentence is not simply report of the topic sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, it’s not just a repeat. [to class:] Do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; all right! Good job! Good job!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title>SIA: Writing a Paragraph Guided Practice #2 (ESL)</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, now, I have three paragraphs in these envelopes. Three paragraphs that were written by intermediate through advanced ESOL students like, like you. Okay? I’ve cut the paragraph up into sentences. I’m going to give everybody a paragraph that’s cut up into parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re going to put the paragraph together, deciding which sentence is the topic sentence, which sentence (which sentences) are the supporting details, and which sentence is the closing sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch. I added a sentence that does not stick to the topic. It’s like putting spaghetti on a hamburger or putting a cookie on a hamburger. So you have to figure out which sentence does not belong, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I—and while you’re doing this, I really want you to remember, these were written by ESOL students just like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so let’s see, you have three… [she indicates a table of students, and asks them to pass materials to other tables of students.] Can you pass paragraph 2 back, and pass paragraph 1 back. So the whole table, discuss this together, please. Any questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; No questions, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Students discuss their paragraphs with other members of their table. The teacher monitors their work. Snippets of conversation can be heard and are listed below]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher (to students at a table):&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so, now we’re not going to, we’re just looking at the cut-up paragraph now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student [reading from one of the strips of paper]:&lt;/strong&gt; “I like improving my English.” Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Now we have to read it. Could you read it? Okay, I read it, okay? “Myself when I”—oh, no! (corrects her reading) “I will feel proud of myself when I began to communicate with others in fluent English.” …So this is belong to this one, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Mm-hm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. [The students at this table discuss.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; So this is not important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right. So you have to figure out what’s the topic sentence, what are the supporting details, and what is the concluding sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that we are finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; okay, you’re finished?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; uh-huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right, good job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so why don’t you just read it out loud to each other…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. (to a fellow student:) You can to read for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student 2:&lt;/strong&gt; “I want—I want a job. I want to work because I need to earn money for my family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student 3:&lt;/strong&gt; “I want to get a good job because I need to pay our bills every month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We hear the teacher in the background speaking to the table of students]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So what’s the topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; To study English continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, good, good. And the supporting details?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; “That’s why I always study and attend English classes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. And then, Tommy, what didn’t stick to the topic there? What sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tommy:&lt;/strong&gt; School and the – oh, I’m sorry. “I studied French in school and I speak perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Teacher returns to the front of the room and addresses the whole class.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right, class, your paragraphs look good. Is everybody ready to present?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; If you will look in your packet here, you actually have copies of these sentences, so I’d like you to follow along while each group reads their paragraph to you. And they’re going to identify to you what each of these sentences, what part each of these sentences plays in the paragraph. Okay, who has “I want a job”? Who has that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. And who is going to be the spokesman of the group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Irma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Irma! Okay. So, Irma, will you please read the paragraph and the class will follow along. And as you read each sentence, tell us, is it the topic sentence, is it a supporting detail, is it the concluding sentence, or does it not stick to the topic? Does it not belong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, I am going to try, and if I need help, my team can to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. “I want a job. I want to work because I need to earn money for my family.” That is the, the topic sentence. Okay? “I want to get a job because I need to pay our bills every month.” (to her classmates:) Could you like to say what is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s supporting sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Supporting. Teacher: Supporting detail, good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; “My kids needs to go to school, and sometimes it is expensive.” Eric?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric:&lt;/strong&gt; Supporting detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Supporting detail, good! Okay. Okay. Ummm… “I want them to learn so they can go on, they become good citizens of this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And what, what is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Supporting sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, and that is supporting detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh-huh. “I won the lottery last month and bought a new car.” Cookies. Spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so class, cross that one out. “I won the lottery last month and bought a new car.” Okay, that’s not talking about him working. Buying a lottery ticket, is that work? Maybe! No, no, not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Then is “I want to work hard now to help my family get prepared for the future.” That is our conclude sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And isn't that beautiful? Let's hear that: I want -- "-- the top of the bun -- "I want to work because I need money for my family” and—closing—[the teacher points to the bottom bun of the hamburger picture] “I want to work hard now to help my family get prepared for the future.” Do you see how they’re similar, but they’re not exactly alike? Like the bun is made of bread, top and bottom, but it’s not exactly the same. Good job! Good job, paragraph 1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title>SIA: Writing a Paragraph Guided Practice #3 (ESL)</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; One more practice that I want you to do at your table. These are also four beautiful paragraphs that were written by ESOL students. So if you—it’s on this paper—if you can take that out, please…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I want you to work in groups of two or three, and I want you to take turns reading the paragraphs. And what you are going to do—here are the directions— you’re going to take turns reading the paragraphs. You’re going to identify again the topic sentence, the supporting details and the closing sentence. And this time, you’re going to think about it: Did this author stick to the topic? Okay?And I’m not going to tell you—maybe I put an extra sentence in there, maybe I didn’t. You decide. Okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I want you to think about this paragraph. Is it a strong paragraph? What do you like about the paragraph? Because remember we said that writing is communication. [Teacher indicates the page of paragraphs she is holding, pointing to each paragraph.] So these four students are not in this room, but they are communicating with you something that is important to them—about English class. About being a good mother. About health, and about caring for planet Earth. So these students wrote something from their hearts to their readers, and you are their readers. So that’s why we have the fourth thing here for you to decide: What do you like about that paragraph? Okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ll be doing this, and we’re – remember, we’re preparing for you to be strong in your understanding of what a paragraph is, so that you can write powerful paragraphs. Go ahead and in groups of two or three, read the paragraphs, follow the directions and share with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Class discusses.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, Irma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student/Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; I have a question. I am not sure, um, what means, um, using the directions, the third point, that say ‘stuck’? What is the meaning of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK, so , we have the present tense is stick. The past tense is stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student/Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, but what does they mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; (gesturing with her hands) Do you know what “stick to the topic” is? (Student nods) Today I stick, yesterday I stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student/Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, OK, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[student discussions at each table, teacher helping as needed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher (to a small group):&lt;/strong&gt; OK, so Mara will read this, and the group will identify the parts, and then, did this author stick to the topic? Or go off and put things in there that doesn’t belong? Ok, then why don’t you go ahead and read that then? (Teacher walks away, fade to teacher in front of the room.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, did you enjoy reading these paragraphs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Aren’t they, aren’t they fabulous paragraphs? Who read “That’s a good English class”? Which group? Did anybody read that? Okay, what, what did you like about that paragraph especially?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; I like the teacher’s, um, dedication. She tried to do, like it says, she writes journals to practice writing and make it watch DVDs to practice the listening. And seems like she’s very, she prepare her classes every time, times come because she, she always gives something to do to the class. And that’s very important for students because they can practicing, like the writing, the journals, watching the pronunciation and the DVDs. So they make a very rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So you could really relate to that paragraph?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, did you, did you think that it was well organized, with the topic and details and the good closing? Did it stick to the topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; It did. A lot of the other, the supporting details were good. Yeah, supporting the topic sentences, yeah. All of them. And yeah, it was, it made me think of our class when you bring us those separate papers to fill, and look for topic sentences, supporting ideas, it help us a lot to practicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you! Thank you, because she’s excited about her class, so thanks. That makes me feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; It makes us feel like we want to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yay! Well, that’s my goal, that’s my goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[fade to another discussion, teacher still at front of class –class discussion of 2 other paragraphs removed from the original, approximately 2.5 minutes]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey, who read the paragraph on health? You all read that, you read about health. Okay, so what did you like about the paragraph on health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; In particular, that this paragraph spoke about a very important problem, especially in the USA because, for example in the topic sentence, the writer wrote: “More and more young people in the world don’t take care of their health.” And it is a big problem because we know that at the supermarket we can buy a lot of things, a lot of sweet things, but health is very important. If your body have to change down the years, and you have to take care about this. So this is big important problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right, so actually, when this person chose, again, a very strong topic, so when you’re going to write, choosing a strong topic is important. Okay, good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s so long, but you can understand at the beginning, what this article is going to explain you. So you have this..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah (many voices)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; and it has some difficult words like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems. So you maybe need a dictionary, but hey, those problems are big problems in the world, and that was explained clearly in that paragraph. And did it stick to the topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; No. No. (many voices)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; It did not stick to the topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So were all the supporting details part of it, or did it have, like, cookies and spaghetti thrown in there? So it stuck to the topic, yeah. “Stick”, present; “stuck”, past. It “stuck” to the topic. Yeah, like this [indicating large piece of paper on the wall] “sticks” to the wall. Stick. In the past it “stuck” to the wall. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and the author doesn’t had something that we don’t need. Everything is useful to understand the article, to understand the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; And that’s why it’s, it’s supported, it’s supported. It made the paragraph stronger by supporting the topic. Now personally, for me, the closing sentences—I have a hard time thinking of a good closing. I love the closings on all of these paragraphs. I think the students did such a good job.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, class, before you start writing a paragraph, let’s just review the parts of a paragraph and if you look at this page in your, in your handouts, the sample paragraph, follow along and help Pilar. She is going to read the sentence and then she is going to ask the class what part of the paragraph is that? But it might not stick to the topic, so you need to say, “Oh, that doesn’t stick to the topic” and we’ll cross that out. You can cross that out on paper. Meanwhile, there’s some sentences up here that are in this paragraph and we’re going to construct the hamburger according to what part of the hamburger each person is holding. Okay? So any questions about what we’re going to do? Okay, Pilar is the teacher now and you are going to answer her questions when she asks—when she reads these sentences and asks you what part of the paragraph has she just read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilar (reading):&lt;/strong&gt; “America, the land of opportunity. The United States is a country that offer many opportunities.” This is the – class, this is a…? Topic? Supporting? What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Class discusses.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilar:&lt;/strong&gt; Topic. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A student places her sentence on the wall, at the top, as they construct a “hamburger” with each sentence. They do this with each sentence that is part of the paragraph in the following lines.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilar:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay , this is topic. Next, “I went to visit my Aunt Bertha last January.” What is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pilar:&lt;/strong&gt; This is spaghetti, okay. Nobody has, no? No, okay, good. “In this country, we can get good jobs and support our families.” Yes…What is—? Support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Support, supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SIA: Writing a Paragraph Guided Practice #5 (ESL)</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;[Teacher is at the front of the room with a whiteboard, class with 10-12 adult learners facing the board. Student are in groups of 3-5 at long tables facing the board – can work in pairs easily.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, class, now we’re going to write, let’s write a group paragraph. You all have wonderful ideas. I thought of a topic sentence that I think, I think is important to you. We’ve talked about this before, and this is the topic sentence: “In the USA, it is important to express your ‘voice’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have students who have come from countries where you are not allowed to express your voice; you may even go to jail for expressing your voice, your opinions, your thoughts and ideas. In this country, it’s your right—freedom of speech, freedom to write. Okay, so this is the idea. I want you, as people who have come from other countries and who have maybe some fresh ideas, some strong ideas on this—what are some ideas that support this topic sentence? What would you like to say that supports that? “In the USA, it is important to express your voice.” Why? Irma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Because I think that if we express our ideas, the people get to know what are our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. [begins to write on the board] “When we express—“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; Some are needs and some are congratulations, too, for this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher (continues):&lt;/strong&gt; “-- our ideas, people can know—“. [teacher has left out the letter N when she writes out “know”; she corrects it.] Okay. Oh. “—Can know our needs.” If I spell something wrong, tell me! Okay, great, okay. “In the USA it is important to express your voice. When we express our ideas, people can know our needs.” What else would go with this? Good start. Thank you, Irma. Zweditu?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zweditu:&lt;/strong&gt; In this country, to immigrant and native people live, is all thing is equal rights, so that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, and how does that go with expressing your voice? It’s, in this country it is our right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Zweditu:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, our right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay! Okay. “In this country, freedom of expression is a right.” Okay. What else? Can you give me another supporting detail? Mercedes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Mercedes:&lt;/strong&gt; Mm-hm, well, in other countries, maybe I have a good idea, but no is free. I don’t can—I don’t feel for free, for spoke and write. And no is, no is work my idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zweditu:&lt;/strong&gt; In this country, everyone have a good idea is possible…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zweditu:&lt;/strong&gt; to make work with your idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so in this country, every person’s idea is valuable, is that what you’re saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zweditu:&lt;/strong&gt; yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow! [fade as Teacher writes statement on board] Okay, now, we’ve been, we’ve been looking at maybe three supporting details. You don’t have to only have three, but three is a good solid number of supporting details. So now we’re going to think of a closing sentence here. So let’s go back, look at this paragraph—see, I mean, you just rattled off this good paragraph here: “In the USA, it is important to express your voice. When we express our ideas, people can know our needs. In this country, freedom of expression is a right. In this country, every person’s idea is valuable.” Wow! Isn’t that a great paragraph? Now, now here’s what I think is the hard part: a good closing. And remember, the closing has to be similar—it has to be similar to the opening, but not just repeating it. It’s a summary of what you have said. So who, who thinks they can come up with a good summary? Remember, it’s going to be similar to this: “In the USA, it is important to express your voice.” Now we’re summarizing all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; It could be, uh, it’s, uh, I’m very, uh… your, your… I’m very happy to live in a country where everyone can express their, theirs, um… express their idea, they’re counted, they’re valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, good. Okay, let’s hang onto that—we just want to get—she wants to express her ideas, too. All right. So, Angela, what were you going to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Angela is too quiet to hear)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, she has one, she wants to say-- She wants to say, “I like, I’m happy to live in a country where everyone’s ideas are valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Take our ideas and our, we have the freedom of speech….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. “I’m happy to live in a country where I have freedom of speech.” [teacher addresses Angela.] And what did you want to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angela:&lt;/strong&gt; In the United States, um… people are happy… are happy because people have, um, total freedom for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so that goes back to Yolanda’s, but it’s sticking to the topic of the voice, freedom of speech, and happy—so you two are in agreement. That’s good! This is a democracy, and we’re agreeing, yay! Okay. [fade as Teacher writes statement on board:]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So, how about, um, let me ask Homera-- since this is your last day with the class, and you’re going to Germany, would you read this? Read the whole paragraph for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homera:&lt;/strong&gt; “In the USA, it is important to express your voice. When we express our ideas, people can know our needs. In this country, freedom of expression is a right. In this country, every person’s idea is valuable. I am happy to live in country where we have freedom of speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yay.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SIA: Writing a Paragraph Closure (ESL)</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;[Begins at the end of Guided Practice 5 – with Teacher at the whiteboard facing students at tables.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, all right. So that’s the end of our lesson today, but before, before you go, I want you to tell me one more time why is writing so important to you. Why is writing to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s exciting when you came to see what you can write and how you can write and what is the mean of that and it’s great, it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; All right! Yay, Irma! Who else wants to say something? Why is writing so important to you? Beautiful! Okay, Angela, over here. Angela wants to say something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Angela:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. The writing is important because people can, outside ideas, feelings; it is important, too, because is the way for, for people to say anything. It’s… yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Beautiful! Alright, good. Ijaz, you want to say something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Ijaz:&lt;/strong&gt; We want to say something, but we cannot understand what can I say, what can I write, is more ideas is coming. Can I want to write just for my life, but can I start this coming on other topics also inside, for my father, for my mother, for my families… It’s too many ideas coming on the head, and that we write, plus, plus, plus, plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, I agree with you so much: sometimes when I’m speaking, I don’t know what to say, or I say something and I can’t take it back. But when you’re writing, you can have time and you can think, and then, “Oh, I don’t want to say that!” and you can erase it. And I agree, writing is nice because you can really take your time and work it through and make it something that you really want to say, exactly what you want to say. And that’s what—that’s a perfect way to end our class today, because again, with the process, we’re taking writing through a process: getting the ideas, starting to organize your ideas, sharing those ideas, getting some feedback. And then finally, our goal for this class is to complete some finished products and publish our finished products, so that we can speak to the future and to our community. All right! Thanks, class. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
