&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Deceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Deceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, so we're done with vocabulary. So let's go ahead and put away the, put away your sheet. We're going to move on to alphabetics. OK. We're going to move on to alphabetics. I need to have, Jennifer and Jacqueline. You guys can move to this back table over here please. Jorge, you, I, you can come over to this table. Manado, you can also go to that back table. You guys, we're going to be doing the comprehension activity while I work with this other group on alphabetics. OK. We're going to be working on the K W L chart. And you guys, your group is at that table over there. Angel, you can join us right up here. Juan, you're fine where you're at. And Vlas, good morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; You're also, your group is over here as well. OK. We're moving on to what I call word parts. OK. Sometimes I say alphabetics, sometimes I say word parts. So, good morning class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher: &lt;/strong&gt;OK, you guys ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Ready, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; OK. Quick question, how many of you have come across a word that you didn't know how to pronounce? Yeah, Angel, yeah, you did. Alright. Now, how many of you didn't know where to begin, or how to begin to break down a word and pronounce it on your own? OK. Alright. Well, would you like to learn how to break down a word into short syllables and pronounce the word all on your own without the teacher?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Great. Great. Today, we're going to be learning about how to identify a closed syllable. And by learning, by knowing how to identify a closed syllable, you'll know what sound the vowel makes in that closed syllable. When you see a word like this, OK, what's the first thing that you do? What's the first thing that you do when you see a big word like this? Cry? No. Maybe ask the teacher. OK. Well, what we're going to be learning today is the first step towards giving you the tools to be able to break this down into short syllables so that you can do it on your own. Sound like a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Alright. Let's get started. Now, before I introduce the closed vowel, let's do a little review on what a syllable in general is. Alright. Let me just do a quick review on what a syllable is. And, you guys don't need to write anything down because I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you copies of this. All I need you to do is just listen. Follow along. So what is a syllable? What is a syllable? A syllable you guys, is a group of letters that has a single vowel sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I have a group of letters here. This is a syllable.The vowel sound that I hear is a short "O", ahhh. Gos. This is a syllable. Group of words. And we only have one vowel sound, "E". De. This is a syllable. Group of letters. And we only hear one vowel sound. In this case is the short "A", ahhh. Ban. Now you're probably asking yourself, Mr. Verdin, how, how do I know what vowel sound that vowel makes in that, in that sym, in that syllable? Well, that's what we're going to be learning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're going to identify the type of syllable it is, and what sound that vowel makes. OK. ‘cause there's many different types of syllables. So let me get started on the syllable that we're going to learn today. &lt;/p&gt;</content>
