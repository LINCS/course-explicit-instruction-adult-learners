        <title>Introduction to the QAR Strategy</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; [one-on-one with an individual student] Today we’re going to work on a reading strategy, and it’s a strategy that you can use to help you answer questions about what you’ve read… and of course, that’s really important when you’re taking those reading tests. [screen text: Introduction]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; So the strategy that we’re going to work on is called Question-Answer Relationships, and sometimes people refer to it as QAR: Question-Answer Relationships. And we’re going to look at the connection—or the relationship—between the question that we’re asked, and the answer that we give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use this strategy, you look at the question that you’re asked, and try to figure out what kind of question it is, because there are different kinds of questions. And so, because there are different kinds of questions, you have different kinds of answers. So, I’m going to show you three different kinds—we’re going to work with 3 different kinds of questions today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question that we’re going to work with is called a “right there” question. And when you read the information that you have, the passage, the selection—sometimes the answer to your questions—it’s right there, in the passage; you can point to it, it’s in a particular sentence or paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there are a couple of places where you find the answer; you have to put them together. So you “think and search” for the answer. This kind of question you might find part of the answer in one place, part of the answer in another place, and you put it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other kind of question is called, “The writer and me”, and for this kind of question, you have to use some of your own knowledge, your own background experience, and put it together with something that is mentioned in the passage or in the article. So it’s the writer giving some of the answer, as well as you knowing something about that before you even have read the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to show you how this works, and I’m going to use this article, called “Keeping Kids Safe”. [Teacher slides a paper with the question types towards student.] We’re going to keep those kinds of questions right there, in front of us. But I want you to go ahead—I’ve had a chance already, of course, to read this, so I want you to have a chance to read it before I talk to you about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; If there’s any words there you don’t know or don’t understand, just ask me and I’ll help you with them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title> QAR Modeling: Right There</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; [working one-on-one with student] …have questions, and we’ll have the article right here so we can look at the article…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question is, “What areas in a neighborhood are not safe for children?” And I’m remembering from what I read that that answer was right there in the passage, that it’s a kind of question where I think I can look right back and find what area is not safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Teacher points out and reads from the article:] “Check your neighborhood for areas that are not safe: abandoned buildings are not safe; areas with lots of trees or bad lighting are not safe.” So I would put that this question is a “right there” kind of question, and that the answer is, “abandoned buildings and areas with trees and areas with bad lighting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Teacher asks student:] Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; [indicating a specific place in the passage]: I found the answer right there!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title>QAR Modeling: Think and Search</title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; [working one-on-one with student, reading passage question] “What should your children know and be able to do to be safe in an emergency?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right… [teacher repeats the question, pausing to break it down into the important parts] “What should your children know… and be able to do… to be safe in an emergency?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, our whole passage was about keeping kids safe, and I seem to remember that I’ve read the word ‘emergency’, and… [teacher looks through the passage, then points part out with her pencil:] All right… [teacher reads from the passage:] “…walk through the neighborhood with your children, show them safe places they can go (a safe place may be a neighbor’s house or a store)…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking I saw ‘emergency’ another place…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[teacher scans text, then finds the place she wants:] Uh-huh, right here in this part of the paragraph… [teacher reads directly from passage:] “Make sure children know their full name, address and phone number, including area code. Practice how to make an emergency phone call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[teacher refers back to the passage question] So it says, “What should your children know and be able to do to be safe in an emergency?” So this kind of question—it really wasn’t just “right there”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[student murmurs something; teacher responds:] You’re right, it was “think and search”, because it was in two places, wasn’t it? I found that word ‘emergency’…&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <title>QAR Modeling: Writer and Me </title>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teacher:&lt;/strong&gt; [reading from questions about passage, with student]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why would you need to tell small children that strangers look like ordinary people?” [repeats, with emphasis:] “Why… would you need to tell small children that strangers look like ordinary people?” I remember this part of the article, because… I kind of thought it was strange when I read it the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[reading from the place in the passage:] “Teach them not to talk to strangers. Teach them that strangers do not look like monsters; they look like ordinary people.” And I was thinking, “Strangers don’t look like monsters?!” Well, if I used that word with my little granddaughter, she might think, if I said, “Don’t talk to strangers”, she might be thinking, “people that look strange are strangers. They look strange; they look scary.” Well, strangers are not necessarily people that look scary, are they? They can look like ordinary people. Strangers are really people that we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[teacher refers back to passage question:] So, why would you need to tell small children that strangers look like ordinary people? That answer isn’t really “right there”; I had to bring some information from my head about that, so it’s really “the writer and me”, because I know a little bit about children.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
